Collection of public notebooks I find useful for random admin tasks as a consultant

## Consulting time tracker

I tend to use Google calendar to track how many billable hours I spend on each project. Often it's useful to get a total number of hours worked between two dates. Often it's even more useful to have a breakdown of what tasks you did and how long each took - either for your own interest or as a client's requirement.

The jupyter notebook ``CalendarAPI.ipynb`` does this. Further links on how to setup your own calendar are within the notebook.

After setup you should have the following files in the same directory as the notebook.

- credentials.json
- token.pickle
